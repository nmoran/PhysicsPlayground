Physics Playground
==================

Some scripts to to illustrate some interesting physical concepts. Will be mostly written in python.

Hofstadter butterfly
--------------
Contained in Hofstadter.py, this is a simple script to generate the iconic Hoftadter butterfly spectrum. This results from a single electron in a weak periodic potential exposed to a magnetic field of changing strength. The core of this script involves finding the eigenvalues of a tri diagonal matrix for which the scipy is used.
