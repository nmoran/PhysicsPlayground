Physics Playground
==================

Some scripts to to illustrate some interesting physical concepts. Will be mostly written in python.

Hofstadter butterfly
--------------
Contained in Hofstadter.py, this is a simple script to generate the iconic Hoftadter butterfly spectrum. This results from a single electron in a weak periodic potential exposed to a magnetic field of changing strength. The core of this script involves finding the eigenvalues of a tri diagonal matrix for which the scipy is used. 

TKNN Animation
--------------
This is a simple script which produces an animation to demonstrate the quantized Hall current (in the weak potential limit). It follows the treatmeant taken the the famous TKNN paper (Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 405â€“408 (1982)) and is inspired by the figures included in this.
